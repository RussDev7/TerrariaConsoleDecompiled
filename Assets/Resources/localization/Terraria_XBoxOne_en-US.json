    "Dialog_176": "They say there is a person who will tell you how to survive in this land... oh wait. That's me.",
    "Dialog_178": "If you want to survive, you will need to create weapons and shelter. Start by chopping down trees and gathering wood.",
    "Dialog_179": "When you have enough wood, open your crafting menu and create a workbench. Workbenches allow you to create more complicated things, as long as you are standing close to them.",
    "Dialog_17": "Keep your eye on the prize, buy a lense!",
    "Dialog_180": "You can build a shelter by placing wood or other blocks in the world. Don't forget to create and place walls.",
    "Dialog_181": "Once you have a wooden sword, you might try to gather some gel from the slimes. Combine wood and gel to make a torch!",
    "Dialog_182": "To interact with backgrounds, use a hammer!",
    "Dialog_183": "You should do some mining to find metal ore. You can craft very useful things with it.",
    "Dialog_184": "Now that you have some ore, you will need to turn it into a bar in order to make items with it. This requires a furnace!",
    "Dialog_185": "You can create a furnace out of torches, wood, and stone. Make sure you are standing near a work bench.",
    "Dialog_186": "You will need an anvil to make most things out of metal bars.",
    "Dialog_187": "Anvils can be crafted out of iron, or purchased from a merchant.",
    "Dialog_188": "Underground are crystal hearts which can be used to increase your max life. You can smash them with a pickaxe.",
    "Dialog_189": "If you gather 5 fallen stars, they can be combined to create an item that will increase your magic capacity.",
    "Dialog_18": "Kosh, kapleck Mog. Oh sorry, that's klingon for 'Buy something or die.'",
    "Dialog_190": "Stars fall all over the world at night. They can be used for all sorts of usefull things. If you see one, be sure to grab it because they disappear after sunrise.",
    "Dialog_191": "There are many different ways you can attract people to move in to our town. They will of course need a home to live in.",
    "Dialog_192": "In order for a room to be considered a home, it needs to have a door, a chair, a table, and a light source.  Make sure the house has walls as well.",
    "Dialog_193": "Two people will not live in the same home. Also, if their home is destroyed, they will look for a new place to live.",
    "Dialog_194": "You can use the housing interface to assign and view housing. Open your inventory and select the house icon.",
    "Dialog_195": "If you want a merchant to move in, you will need to gather plenty of money. 50 silver coins should do the trick!",
    "Dialog_196": "For a nurse to move in, you might want to increase your maximum life.",
    "Dialog_197": "If you had a gun, I bet an arms dealer might show up to sell you some ammo!",
    "Dialog_198": "You should prove yourself by defeating a strong monster. That will get the attention of a dryad.",
    "Dialog_199": "Make sure to explore the dungeon thoroughly. There may be prisoners held deep within.",
    "Dialog_19": "{myPlayerName} is it? I've heard good things, friend!",
    "Dialog_1": "I hope a scrawny kid like you isn't all that is standing between us and Cthulhu's Eye.",
    "Dialog_200": "Perhaps the old man by the dungeon would like to join us now that his curse has been lifted.",
    "Dialog_201": "Hang on to any bombs you might find. A demolitionist may want to have a look at them.",
    "Dialog_202": "Are goblins really so different from us that we couldn't live together peacefully?",
    "Dialog_203": "I heard there was a powerful wizard who lives in these parts.  Make sure to keep an eye out for him next time you go underground.",
    "Dialog_204": "If you combine lenses at a demon altar, you might be able to find a way to summon a powerful monster. You will want to wait until night before using it, though.",
    "Dialog_205": "You can create worm bait with rotten chunks and vile powder. Make sure you are in a corrupt area before using it.",
    "Dialog_206": "Demonic altars can usually be found in the corruption. You will need to be near them to craft some items.",
    "Dialog_207": "You can make a grappling hook from a hook and 3 chains. Skeletons found deep underground usually carry hooks, and chains can be made from iron bars.",
    "Dialog_208": "If you see a pot, be sure to smash it open. They contain all sorts of useful supplies.",
    "Dialog_209": "There is treasure hidden all over the world. Some amazing things can be found deep underground!",
    "Dialog_20": "I hear there's a secret treasure... oh never mind.",
    "Dialog_210": "Smashing a shadow orb will sometimes cause a meteor to fall out of the sky. Shadow orbs can usually be found in the chasms around corrupt areas.",
    "Dialog_211": "You should focus on gathering more life crystals to increase your maximum life.",
    "Dialog_212": "Your current equipment simply won't do. You need to make better armor.",
    "Dialog_213": "I think you are ready for your first major battle. Gather some lenses from the eyeballs at night and take them to a demon altar.",
    "Dialog_214": "You will want to increase your life before facing your next challenge. Fifteen hearts should be enough.",
    "Dialog_215": "The ebonstone in the corruption can be purified using some powder from a dryad, or it can be destroyed with explosives.",
    "Dialog_216": "Your next step should be to explore the corrupt chasms.  Find and destroy any shadow orb you find.",
    "Dialog_217": "There is a old dungeon not far from here. Now would be a good time to go check it out.",
    "Dialog_218": "You should make an attempt to max out your available life. Try to gather twenty hearts.",
    "Dialog_219": "There are many treasures to be discovered in the jungle, if you are willing to dig deep enough.",
    "Dialog_21": "Angel Statue you say? I'm sorry, I'm not a junk dealer.",
    "Dialog_220": "The underworld is made of a material called hellstone. It's perfect for making weapons and armor.",
    "Dialog_221": "When you are ready to challenge the keeper of the underworld, you will have to make a living sacrifice. Everything you need for it can be found in the underworld.",
    "Dialog_222": "Make sure to smash any demon altar you can find. Something good is bound to happen if you do!",
